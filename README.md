  $$
  M = \frac{P \times r}{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}
  $$
  where:
  * $P$ = loan amount
  * $r$ = monthly interest rate (`annualRate / 12 / 100`)
  * $n$ = total payments in months (`termYears * 12`)
  
* **Interest-Only**
  $$
  M = P \times r
  $$
  Balloon payment: original loan $P$ due at the end.

* **LTV (Loan-to-Value)**
  $$
  LTV = \frac{Loan}{PropertyValue} \times 100\%
  $$

Would you like me to also include a **screenshots / demo GIF section** in the README (so it looks professional on GitHub/Azure), or keep it lightweight text-only?
